 Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle consisting of three poles, and a set amount of disks on the very left pole stacked from biggest diameter on the bottom, to smallest on the top. The goal is to move all of the disks from the left pole to the right pole with the restrictions of only moving the top disk of a pole, and being forbidden to stack a bigger disk onto a smaller disk. With N disks, there's always a unique optimal solution with 2**N - 1 steps.

Print out all the steps of the optimal solution to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle consisting of nine disks. Each step describes the number of the starting pole and the pole it goes to. (i.e: 1 -> 3 would mean put top disk from Pole 1 onto Pole 3.)
