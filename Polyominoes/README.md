 A polyomino is a 2D shape formed by joining squares along common edges, such that all squares are connected. Output each possible polyomino (including every rotation), up to a size of 6, in any order. Separate each polyomino by an empty line.

There should be a total of 1 monomino, 2 dominoes, 6 trominoes, 19 tetrominoes, 63 pentominoes, and 216 hexominoes.
