 Given the set of edges of a directed graph, print the linear order of its nodes. The order is always unique. Each edge is given on a separate line; an edge from node u to node v is given as u v. The nodes are numbered from 0 to N - 1, where 2 ≤ N ≤ 10 is the number of nodes in the graph.

This is similar to the tsort utility, except that output nodes are separated with spaces instead of newlines.
