 Given a list of sentences, print the transposed representation of each input.

Consider the sentence: all work and no play makes jack a dull boy.

To transpose it, first write each word on a separate line:

₁₂₃₄₅
↓↓↓↓↓
all
work
and
no
play
makes
jack
a
dull
boy

Then read the block of text top to bottom, left to right, inserting a space after the last letter of each column, which yields:

awanpmjadb lonolaauo lrdakcly kyekl s.
