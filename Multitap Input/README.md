 Many older mobile phone designs allow text to be entered on a numeric E.161 keypad. The numbers 2-9 are labeled with letters: 

{
    "A": "2", "B": "22", "C": "222",
	"D": "3", "E": "33", "F": "333",
	"G": "4", "H": "44", "I": "444",
	"J": "5", "K": "55", "L": "555",
	"M": "6", "N": "66", "O": "666",
	"P": "7", "Q": "77", "R": "777", "S": "7777",
	"T": "8", "U": "88", "V": "888",
	"W": "9", "X": "99", "Y": "999", "Z": "9999",
	" ": "0"
}

 Pressing a number key once enters the first letter shown on the button, pressing it twice in a row enters the second letter shown on the button, and so on. Two letters located on the same number key can be entered consecutively by waiting a short period of time between entering each letter. Pressing the 0 key enters a space.

Given a sequence of button presses and pauses (represented by spaces), print the equivalent text. No run of one digit will be longer than the number of letters on that key. Pauses may occur between any two letters, not just those on the same key.
