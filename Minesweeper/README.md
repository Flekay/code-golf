 Minesweeper is a video game in which the player must clear a board without detonating any of the hidden mines scattered throughout the grid of clickable tiles.

Each argument represents a ten-by-ten board with thirteen mine tiles, denoted by X, and the rest being safe tiles, denoted by _.

Print a solved Minesweeper board for each argument, separated by blank lines. Replace each mine with F as if it were flagged. And replace each safe tile with the number of adjacent mines.
