 Set is a card game played with a deck of 81 unique cards that vary in four features, each of which takes on three values:

    Number of shapes: each card contains either 1, 2, or 3 shapes.
    Color: the shapes on each card are either Red, Green, or Purple.
    Shading: each shape is either Solid, Half-shaded, or Empty.
    Shape: the shapes on each card are either Ovals, Diamonds, or Waves.

A card is represented by the values of its features, with each value encoded by its first character. For example, 2RSW means 2 Red Solid Waves.

The goal of the game is to find a set of three cards, such that for each of the four features, either all three cards have different values or all three cards have the same value. For example, 2RSW, 2PHW, and 2GEW form a set because they all have the same number and shape, and none of them have the same color or shading.

Arguments consist of twelve cards that are guaranteed to contain exactly one set. For each argument, print the contained set with the cards in order of their appearance separated by spaces, one set per line.
